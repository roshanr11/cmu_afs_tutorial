# Setting up SSH on your computer
## Linux

<br/>
First, you should choose a terminal. Your distro almost certainly has one already, but if you donâ€™t, the default one you can download another. Some popular terminals are:

<br/>
- Terminator
- Konsole
- Gnome Terminal
- xterm
- xrvt-unicode

<br/>

Once you have downloaded the terminal, open the terminal and type the following replacing `ANDREWID` with your Andrew ID.

```
ssh ANDREWID@unix.andrew.cmu.edu
```
The terminal will prompt you to enter your password - use the same password you use to log onto WebISO
