# AFS Workflow Overview

---
**NOTE**
Make sure to work on assignments in your private directory, otherwise anyone can see your files which counts as an academic integrity violation!

---

Steps:

1. ssh into AFS
```
ssh ANDREWID@unix.andrew.cmu.edu
```
   
2. Enter your private directory
```
cd private
```

3. Create a class folder if you havenâ€™t already
```
mkdir 15xxx
```

4. scp handout into directory (or download from autolab)
```
scp C:/User/ABC/homework.tar ANDREWID@unix.andrew.cmu.edu:~/private/15xxx
```

5. Use vim or VSCode extension to edit files
Helpful extensions like SFTP can let you edit files locally and then upload them to AFS from your editor.
