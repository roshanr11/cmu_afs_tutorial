# About

The AFS Tutorial is created by Roshan Ram, Grace Kang, and Shreya Manjunath, as part of 76-270, 
Writing for The Professions. We aim to build out a lightweight website, which helps students understand 
the barebones basics of how to use the Andrew File System, in a user-friendly manner. 

References: We draw upon the structure created by 15-150's [smlhelp.github.io](https://github.com/smlhelp/book).
